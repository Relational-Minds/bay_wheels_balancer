# bay_wheels_balancer
The Bay Wheels Station Balancer is an event-driven operational tool designed to solve the "rebalancing problem" in bike-share systems (where some stations become full while others are empty). Unlike traditional manual scheduling, this system uses real-time data and geospatial analytics to predict demand and automate logistics.
